## GitFlow, Git Commands, and Terminology

## What is Gitflow?

Gitflow is a branching model for Git. It allows for parallel development, collaboration, release staging area, and support for emergency fixes. 

#### Parallel Development:
Gitflow makes parallel development really easy by isolating new work from finished work. New work is done in feature branches, and is only merged back into main body of code when the creator is happy with the code and thinks its ready for release. 

#### Collaboration:
Feature branches make it easier for developers to collaborate on the same feature and easily see what other collaborators are doing, becasue changes that are made are only the ones to get the feature working.
